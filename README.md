# MVP Task Planner

The MVP Task Planner is a sophisticated React application designed to help project managers and teams optimize their MVP development process through intelligent task selection and resource allocation. It implements advanced constraint satisfaction algorithms to maximize project value while adhering to specified constraints like budget, time, and required skills.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with attributes like price, hours, value, and required skills.
- **Constraint Definition**: Specify project constraints such as maximum budget, maximum hours, and minimum required skills for different roles (e.g., Design, Frontend, Backend).
- **Algorithm-Based Task Selection**: Run different optimization algorithms to determine the optimal set of tasks that maximize value while respecting the defined constraints.
- **Results Visualization**: View the selected tasks in a table, along with a summary of the total value, cost, and hours.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize the distribution of skills and other metrics for the selected tasks.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for user comfort.
- **Persistent State**: The application state (tasks, constraints) is saved to local storage, so your data persists across sessions.
- **Export Results**: Export your task selection results as PDF for sharing with stakeholders.
