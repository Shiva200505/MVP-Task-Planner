1. CODE STRUCTURE EXPLANATION
----------------------------

1.1 Prediction Algorithm Components
----------------------------------

The MVP Task Planner implements multiple algorithms for task selection optimization under constraints. Each algorithm solves the same core problem: selecting an optimal subset of tasks that maximizes total value while satisfying budget, time, and skill constraints. The system includes six distinct algorithms:

a) Brute Force Algorithm
   - Enumerates all possible subsets of tasks (2^n combinations)
   - Evaluates each subset against constraints
   - Returns the subset with maximum value that satisfies all constraints
   - Time complexity: O(2^n)
   - Safety cap at n=22 to prevent UI freezing

b) Dynamic Programming Algorithm
   - Implements a modified 0/1 knapsack approach with budget as the primary dimension
   - Tracks hours and skills as secondary constraints
   - Builds solution incrementally by considering each task's inclusion/exclusion
   - Time complexity: O(n * B) where B is the maximum budget
   - Efficient when budget values are reasonably small integers

c) Meet-in-the-Middle Algorithm
   - Splits task set into two halves
   - Enumerates all possible subsets for each half
   - Uses two-pointer technique to find optimal combinations
   - Time complexity: O(2^(n/2))
   - Safety cap at n=30 to prevent excessive computation

d) Branch & Bound Algorithm
   - Uses depth-first search with pruning
   - Sorts tasks by value/price ratio for better pruning efficiency
   - Maintains upper bounds on remaining possible value
   - Time complexity: O(2^n) worst case, but significantly pruned in practice
   - Fallback to Greedy when no feasible solution is found

e) Greedy Algorithm
   - Sorts tasks by value/price ratio
   - Selects tasks in order while constraints are satisfied
   - Includes a second pass to satisfy minimum skill requirements
   - Time complexity: O(n log n)
   - Used as fallback for other algorithms when problem size exceeds safety caps

f) Bitset DP Algorithm
   - Uses bit manipulation to track achievable budget sums
   - Reconstructs solution by tracking predecessors
   - Time complexity: O(n * B / word_size)
   - Efficient for problems with moderate budget ranges

1.2 Mathematical Models
----------------------

The system employs several mathematical models:

a) Multi-Constraint Knapsack Problem
   - Core mathematical formulation: maximize Σ(value_i * x_i) subject to:
     * Σ(price_i * x_i) ≤ maxBudget
     * Σ(hours_i * x_i) ≤ maxHours
     * For each skill k: Σ(skills_i[k] * x_i) ≥ minSkills[k]
   - Variables x_i are binary (0 or 1) indicating task selection

b) Value Optimization Models
   - Value/cost ratio (v/c) for greedy selection and sorting
   - Deficit reduction per unit cost for skill constraint satisfaction
   - Upper bound estimation for branch and bound pruning

c) Bitset Operations
   - Bit manipulation for efficient state representation
   - Shifted bitsets to represent achievable budget sums
   - Predecessor tracking for solution reconstruction

1.3 Data Processing Techniques
-----------------------------

The system employs several data processing techniques:

a) Subset Enumeration
   - Bit masking for efficient subset generation
   - Binary representation of task inclusion/exclusion

b) Dynamic Arrays
   - Tabulation for dynamic programming states
   - Memoization of intermediate results

c) Sorting and Filtering
   - Sorting by value/price ratio
   - Binary search for efficient combination finding
   - Two-pointer technique for combining partial solutions

d) Aggregation Functions
   - Reduction operations for calculating totals (value, cost, hours)
   - Accumulation of skill points across selected tasks

e) Constraint Validation
   - Multi-stage constraint checking (max constraints vs. min constraints)
   - Early pruning of infeasible solutions

1.4 Input/Output Flow
--------------------

The system's input/output flow follows this pattern:

INPUT:
1. Task List: Array of task objects with properties:
   - id: Unique identifier
   - name: Task description
   - price: Cost in budget units
   - hours: Time required in hours
   - value: Business value metric
   - skills: Object mapping skill categories to point values

2. Constraints:
   - maxBudget: Maximum budget allocation
   - maxHours: Maximum time allocation
   - minSkills: Minimum required skill points per category

PROCESSING:
1. Algorithm selection by user
2. Algorithm execution with tasks and constraints
3. Evaluation of all feasible solutions
4. Selection of optimal solution based on total value

OUTPUT:
1. AlgorithmResult object containing:
   - selectedTasks: Array of selected task objects
   - totalValue: Sum of selected task values
   - totalCost: Sum of selected task prices
   - totalHours: Sum of selected task hours
   - totalSkills: Aggregated skill points by category
   - algorithmInfo: Metadata about the algorithm used

2. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM EXPLANATION
-----------------------------------

2.1 Recommendation Logic
-----------------------

The recommendation system in MVP Task Planner is built around optimization algorithms that select the best combination of tasks based on multiple constraints. The core recommendation logic follows these principles:

a) Value Maximization
   - Primary objective is to maximize total business value
   - All algorithms aim to find the subset of tasks with highest cumulative value
   - Value is treated as the primary optimization target

b) Constraint Satisfaction
   - Hard constraints must be satisfied (budget, hours, minimum skills)
   - Two-tier constraint checking:
     * Maximum constraints (budget, hours) checked first for efficiency
     * Minimum constraints (skills) checked after to validate solutions

c) Algorithm Selection
   - Different algorithms provide different trade-offs between:
     * Optimality (finding the absolute best solution)
     * Performance (computation time and resource usage)
     * Problem size handling (ability to handle large task sets)
   - Users can select algorithms based on their specific needs

d) Fallback Mechanisms
   - Safety caps prevent excessive computation for large inputs
   - Greedy algorithm serves as fallback when other algorithms exceed limits
   - Empty result returned when no feasible solution exists

2.2 User Preference Processing
-----------------------------

User preferences are incorporated through:

a) Constraint Definition
   - Users define budget and time constraints
   - Users specify minimum skill requirements across categories
   - These constraints directly shape the solution space

b) Task Value Assignment
   - Users assign value metrics to tasks
   - These values drive the optimization process
   - Higher-valued tasks are prioritized in the selection

c) Algorithm Selection
   - Users can choose which algorithm to apply
   - This allows customization based on problem characteristics:
     * Small problems: Exact algorithms (Brute Force, Dynamic Programming)
     * Medium problems: Approximation algorithms (Meet-in-the-Middle)
     * Large problems: Heuristic algorithms (Greedy)

d) Interactive Exploration
   - Users can adjust constraints and immediately see results
   - This enables what-if analysis and scenario exploration
   - Facilitates finding the right balance between constraints

2.3 Scoring/Ranking Methodology
-----------------------------

The system employs several scoring and ranking methodologies:

a) Value-Based Ranking
   - Primary ranking is by total business value
   - Solutions with higher total value are preferred

b) Value/Cost Efficiency
   - Tasks are often ranked by value/price ratio
   - This metric identifies tasks that provide most value per budget unit
   - Used extensively in the Greedy algorithm and for sorting in Branch & Bound

c) Skill Deficit Reduction Scoring
   - When minimum skill constraints are not met, tasks are scored by:
     * How much they reduce the skill deficit
     * Normalized by their cost (deficit reduction per unit cost)
   - This helps efficiently satisfy skill requirements

d) Feasibility Filtering
   - Solutions are first filtered by hard constraints
   - Only feasible solutions are considered for ranking
   - When no feasible solution exists, this is clearly indicated

e) Algorithm Performance Metrics
   - Theoretical time complexity is provided for each algorithm
   - This helps users understand the performance characteristics
   - Normalized theoretical cost is computed for visualization

   - Constraint validation functions
   - Solution evaluation functions
   - Algorithm selection and execution

b) Task Evaluation (algorithms.js)
   ```javascript
   function evaluateSelection(tasks) {
     const totalValue = tasks.reduce((s, t) => s + t.value, 0);
     const totalCost = tasks.reduce((s, t) => s + t.price, 0);
     const totalHours = tasks.reduce((s, t) => s + t.hours, 0);
     const totalSkills = tasks.reduce(
       (acc, t) => {
         Object.keys(t.skills).forEach((k) => {
           acc[k] = (acc[k] || 0) + t.skills[k];
         });
         return acc;
       },
       { D: 0, FE: 0, BE: 0, DevOps: 0, QA: 0 }
     );
     return { totalValue, totalCost, totalHours, totalSkills };
   }
   ```
   This function aggregates the total value, cost, hours, and skills from a set of selected tasks.

c) Constraint Validation (algorithms.js)
   ```javascript
   function satisfiesConstraints(selectionTotals, constraints) {
     if (selectionTotals.totalCost > constraints.maxBudget) return false;
     if (selectionTotals.totalHours > constraints.maxHours) return false;
     for (const skill of Object.keys(constraints.minSkills)) {
       if ((selectionTotals.totalSkills[skill] || 0) < constraints.minSkills[skill]) {
         return false;
       }
     }
     return true;
   }
   ```
   This function checks if a selection satisfies all constraints (budget, hours, skills).

d) Algorithm Selection (algorithms.js)
   ```javascript
   export function runAlgorithmByName(tasks, constraints, name) {
     switch (name) {
       case 'Brute Force':
         return bruteForce(tasks, constraints);
       case 'Dynamic Programming':
         return dynamicProgramming(tasks, constraints);
       case 'Meet-in-the-Middle':
         return meetInTheMiddle(tasks, constraints);
       case 'Branch & Bound':
         return branchAndBound(tasks, constraints);
       case 'Greedy':
         return greedy(tasks, constraints);
       case 'Bitset DP':
         return bitsetDP(tasks, constraints);
       default:
         return greedy(tasks, constraints, { fallbackOf: name });
     }
   }
   ```
   This function routes algorithm selection to the appropriate implementation.
